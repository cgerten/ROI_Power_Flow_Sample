    "While the static load flow cases are useful, there is a need within the industry for more depth in order to understand how new generators or network reinforcements impact the system during normal operation. Existing optimized economic dispatch tools such as PLEXOS and GAMS are used within power system planning to simulate realistic operation while meeting various constraints. These tools are useful within the industry, but remain computationally intensive, expensive, and take signficiant time to produce outputs with different sensitivites such as ECP constraint reports. \n",

    "In light of the recent decision on Large Energy User connection, there will be a push for Eirgrid to create a network capacity tool similar to what has been created for the distribution network by ESB. It may not be feasible to have a new transmission network capacity tool supported by data from quarterly simulations using PLEXOS. Instead, this pandapower based tool is a capable alternative. "
