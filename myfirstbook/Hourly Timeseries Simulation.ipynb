    "Transmission planners increasingly require accurate hourly simulations to assess the operational impact of integrating new renewable generation or network reinforcements. While the static load flow cases are useful, there is a need within the industry for more depth in order to understand how new generators or network reinforcements impact the system during normal operation. Unlike traditional tools (e.g., PLEXOS, GAMS, PSSE, TARA), this Python-based solution using PandaPower significantly reduces cost and analysis time while maintaining accuracy.\n",

    "In light of the recent decision on Large Energy User connection, there will be a push for Eirgrid to create a network capacity tool similar to what has been created for the distribution network by ESB. It may not be feasible to have a new transmission network capacity tool supported by data from quarterly simulations using PLEXOS. Instead, this pandapower based tool is a capable alternative. "

    "The first stage in the timeseries simulation part of this tool consists of creating a balanced power system model for each hour. The model is given a set of hourly values representing demand factor of peak, wind capacity factor and solar capacity factor. Each hourly simulation is conducted by creating a balanced load-generation model, dispatching generation units according to EirGridâ€™s priority dispatch rules, and ensuring network constraints are observed. \n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves room for edits, but keeps the focus on hourly load flow and realistic system dispatch. If the user would like specific battery storage projects with duration of 8 hours and others with 4 hour duration, they are able to incorporate that. Currently the script operates dispatching all battery storage uniformly, charging when renewable generation is high and discharging when renewables are low. This is another area that can be modified, if specific projects seek to dispatch based on local generation/demand rather than central system-wide dispatch. Likewise, edits can be made for specifc large energy users even though the currently operation assumes uniform demand behavior according to the system wide hourly demand factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "A balanced and converged network model is created for each hour at a rate of roughly 1463 hours (~2 months) in under 25 minutes using standard AC newton raphson powerflow solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the dispatch balancing is completed for each network model, the nodal analysis begins. Contingency analysis is completed for each hour, identifying the worst case contingency for each branch in the system greater or equal to 110kV. For each branch that experiences a worst case contingency greater than a user-defined \"overload threshold\", shift factors are gathered and aggregated according to each bus. In doing this, the user can determine which nodes have a greater contribution to all worst case overloads for each hour in the simulation. There are two functional ways to complete this, either by AC powerflow intact and contingency analysis, or AC power flow intact with DC LODF approximation for the contingency analysis. The latter being the most time efficient, processing 2 months of hourly data in 2-3 hours. "
