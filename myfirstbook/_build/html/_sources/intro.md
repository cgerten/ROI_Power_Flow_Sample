# Welcome to a new power system screening tool for the Republic of Ireland

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how high voltage transmission screening can be done for new wind, solar, or battery storage projects. 

- By using open source tools such as PandaPower, the objective is to accurately model the Irish transmission system and provide quick assessments for new capacity. 
- This tool is continuously improving by monitoring public data, it demonstrates the ability to keep up with rapid changes in the Irish renewable energy industry.
- Generator list, network topology, and other features of the network can be altered in order to fit the needs of the user with minimal turnaround time.

Why does this matter/So what?

As the Irish power system further increases its renewable energy penetration level, it is expected that prioritization will become more prevalent. That is to say that certain projects within the NDP may be prioritized above others according to the net impact to the system or their ability to unlock more renewable energy. TYTFS, ECP Constraint Reports, Shaping our Electricity Future, and other PLEXOS based analyses are recognized as an important industry signal for identifying beneficial parts of the grid to connect. This tool seeks to supplement those resources by filling a need for a tool that is more flexible and accessible.
