# Welcome to a new power system screening tool for the Republic of Ireland

This sample demonstrates the capabilities of a high-voltage transmission screening tool designed specifically to evaluate new wind, solar, or battery storage projects within Irelandâ€™s transmission system. 

- By using open source tools such as PandaPower, the objective is to accurately model the Irish transmission system and provide quick assessments for new capacity. 
- This tool is continuously improving by monitoring public data, it demonstrates the ability to keep up with rapid changes in the Irish renewable energy industry.
- Users can quickly customize generator lists, network topology, and other network parameters, enabling tailored and rapid project screening.

Why does this matter/So what?

As the Irish power system further increases its renewable energy penetration level, it is expected that prioritization will become more prevalent. That is to say that certain projects within the NDP may be prioritized above others according to the net impact to the system or their ability to unlock more renewable energy. TYTFS, ECP Constraint Reports, Shaping our Electricity Future, and other PLEXOS based analyses are recognized as an important industry signal for identifying beneficial parts of the grid to connect. This tool seeks to supplement those resources by filling a need for a tool that is more flexible and accessible.
