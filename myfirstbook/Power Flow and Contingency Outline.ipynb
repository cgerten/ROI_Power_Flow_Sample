    "The tool is built and regularly updated using public sources including but not limited to Eirgrid's Ten Year Transmission Forecast Statement (TYTFS). The model operates in a simple manner for powerflow analysis, utilizing the open source tool PandaPower and other python functionality for data processing. It can easily be updated to reflect a range of scenarios and study years in order to meet the needs of the user. At the moment it only models ROI, does not model any NI network but can be expanded as necessary to fit further needs. \n",

    "**Determining optimal system wind and solar capacity factors to obtain convergence**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to build cases for screening, it's important to first determine what the maximum tollerable wind and solar capacity factors are that will still allow each case to solve and converge properly. The goal being to find the levels of renewable energy dispatch that allow the system to converge for each unique case. Each unique case is meant to represent a slice of time from an average winter day and average summer day, taking the typical scaled demand for that time of day and meeting it with the maximum amount of wind or solar generation that is statistically likely to occur at that time. This is informed by assessing hourly dispatch data from ECP constraint reports, Tomorrow's Energy Scenarios (TES), and other data from Eirgrid and ESB. The below screenshot is an example output that feeds into the next stages as the starting point capacity factors used for each case under study.\n",

Instead, they represent points with varying demand in order to help the user understand both the system response to each dispatch and the likelihood of each cases' occurence according to the wind and solar capacity factors.

Each line is color coded based on intact line loading, turning more red-tinted as the loading increases and blue as the line loading decreases. In the above example, Cahir-Doon experiences a line loading of roughly 100%. Arrows on each line display the real power flow direction. By hovering over each node, results from the test BESS net impact are found, allowing the user to quickly compare which nodes would have a better net loading impact by having a charging or discharging generator connected at the node. \n",

Not only does this provide a comprehensive view of the system as to where additional generation or demand can be placed to have minimal impact on loading, but it also provides a view as to which nodes are likely to be prioritized when curtailment allocation needs to take place to alleviate transmission constraint. This clarity on which constraints become \"governing\" is important as the TSO shifts its perspective as to which network upgrades will be prioritized and renewable generation connecting ahead of select upgrades.
