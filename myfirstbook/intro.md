# Welcome to a new power system screening tool for the Republic of Ireland

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how high voltage transmission screening can be done for new wind, solar, or battery storage projects. 

- By using open source tools such as PandaPower, the objective is to accurately model the Irish transmission system and provide quick assessments for new capacity. 
- This tool is continuously improving by monitoring public data, it demonstrates the ability to keep up with rapid changes in the Irish renewable energy industry.
- Generator list, network topology, and other features of the network can be altered in order to fit the needs of the user with minimal turnaround time.
